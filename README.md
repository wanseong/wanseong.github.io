Picked Hangul Syllables.　<link>https://wanseong.github.io</link>

Hangul Syllables of KS X 1001 includes only 2,350 characters—about 21% of modern Hangul Syllables—, and it is insufficient to use it actually. If use every 11,172 characters, these problems disappear, but 11,172 characters are probably <strong>too many</strong>.

Using 11,172 characters when you make fonts, make games, or otherwise need to output certain Hangul can be too much effort and can consume too much resources. And in fact, there are a lot of Hangul characters which is not usually used in 11,172 characters.

Therefore, I would like to add the required Hangul characters based on 2,350 characters of KS X 1001. If you have Hangul characters that need to add, click the ‘<strong>REQUEST CHARACTERS</strong> (on the website)’, and let me know the Hangul characters that need to add and reasons to add or sources.

Planned by Quiple.
